<h2 align="center">Firefox Extension Template</h2>

**⚡ Fast Development**: Firefox Extension Template provides a starting point for developers to quickly create new Firefox extensions.

The template includes all the necessary files and directories for a basic extension, such as:

- manifest.json
- background script
- content script
- popup window

It also includes a basic configuration for permissions, icons, and options page, along with a sample code for message passing between different parts of the extension.

**✨ Hassle-free Setup**: Developers can simply clone or download the project and start modifying the code to suit their specific needs, without having to worry about the initial setup and boilerplate.

**✊ Out-of-box Support**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [React 18](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting Started

**Generate a new repository:**

<a href="https://github.com/dhuyy/firefox-extension-template/generate"><img src="public/generate-readme.png" width="30%"/></a>

**Install dependecies using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest):**

```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

**Local Development:**

```bash
yarn start
```

- Access [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and choose to edit **Popup** or **Options** page.
  - This command is intended solely to work on the popup and options pages design. If you want end-to-end interaction with the Firefox API, refer to the `build` command bellow.

**Build:**

```bash
yarn build
# or
yarn build:watch
```

- Access the `about:addons` page, enable **Developer Mode**, click on **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder that was generated by the `build` command.
  - After loading your extension for the first time, you only need to click on the `Refresh` button to reload it.
  - Use the `build:watch` command to automatically rebuild your extension upon any code changes.
- The `build` command also generates a `zip` file on the project root. This file can be used to publish your extension on the Firefox Web Store.
